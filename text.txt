 What is a situation where a document store (like MongoDB) is appropriate, and #  what is a situation where it is not appropriate?
MongoDB is a NoSQl database where teh objects are stored as separate documents instead of in column
and rows format as in SQL. It is especially useful when your schema is subject to frequent additions
and changes during rapid development. Since it is used by having views compared to queries done by
SQL, whenever the schema changes or a new document is added, the view doesn't have to be generated from scratch.
Instead, It is updated whenever a new document is added to the document store. It is good for analytics, e-commerce products catalog, configuration,
information relating to mobile and social networking websites, evolving data requirements, among many
other use cases.

 What is "NewSQL", and what is it trying to achieve?
NewSQL is trying to solve the database problems like organizations having to deal with complex data
from multiple sources. Currently organizations use Relational Database Management Systems which are unable
to cope with huge amount of complex data. NewSQL provied the same scalable performance of NoSQL Systems while
mainting the ACID provided by traditional database systems.
